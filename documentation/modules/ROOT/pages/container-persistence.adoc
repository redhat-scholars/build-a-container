_10 MINUTE EXERCISE_


Containers are meant to be run as "immutable" instances that exactly match the state of the image that they were started from (as we saw in the last section).  However, there many scenarios where adjusting this otherwise immutable state would be useful such as:

* Having the containers running the same image run differently in different environments (e.g. Pre-Production vs Production environments)
** For instance, having applications in the container consume different configuration data based on the environment
* Persisting state beyond the life of the container (e.g. Databases, logfiles)
* Sharing state between containers  

Luckily, containers have facilities to support all these things.  We'll explore some of these features in this section

[#mounting_volumes]
== Mounting Volumes

Whilst containers have their own immutable filesystem, it is possible for containers to "mount" volumes that are outside the container's filesystem.  This opens up opportunities for persisting state on those mounted filesystems or sharing that state with processes outside the container.

[TIP]
====
This can also open a number of security concerns for our containers as we'll see later on!
====

Going back to our website, let's see how we can run our webserver in such a way that we can persist our {guestbook-record-file}.  Our strategy will be to have the container write to a file that is **local to our VM filesystem** instead of into the container's filesystem.

. First, let's remove (and stop) any container that we might have running (such as the container based on `{apache-committed-container-image}`): 
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman rm -a \
    --force #<.>
----
<.> This is a bit of a violent way to stop and remove a running container.  It's a little bit like using `kill -9` to stop a linux process.
+
. Since we're going to use the VM's filesystem for persistence, we don't need to use our committed image (`{apache-committed-container-image}`) anymore, especially now that we've copied off of it the `{guestbook-record-file}` we'd like to use.  Let's remove that image from our machinefootnote:[You can keep images around if you'd like, but like VM snapshots they take of space on the host filesystem.  Generally it's good practice to remove images from your system that you are no longer using]
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman rmi \#<.>
   localhost/{apache-committed-container-image} #<.>
----
<.> `rmi` stands for _remove image_.  Don't confuse this with `rm` which has to do with removing containers that are stopped
<.> We're removing based on the image name.  We could also remove by `IMAGE ID`
+
. If the command worked, you should see output like the following: 
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
Untagged: localhost/{apache-committed-container-image}:latest
Deleted: {commit-container-image-id-long}
----
+
. Next, we'll [#podman_run_httpd]#run# our initial `{apache-server-image-insecure}` image, but this time with an additional `-v` option
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
podman run \
    --privileged \
    -d \
    -p 8081:80/tcp \
    --name {apache-server-container-name} \
    -v {container-workshop-exercise-path}:/var/log/www:Z \#<.>
    {apache-server-image-insecure}
----
<.> The format of the volume mount option is <host_path>:<container_path>:<options>.  In our case, we're mounting `{container-workshop-exercise-path}` at `/var/log/www` in the container.  The `Z` option is for SELinux it tells podman to relabel the volume's content to match the label inside the container

[#test_mount]
== Testing the Volume Mount

Now that the container is running mounted to the `{container-workshop-exercise-path}` on the host, we should be able to test out its effects

. Make sure you have the `{guestbook-record-file}` open in VSCode in an editor pane next to the *Browser Preview* pane as shown
+
image::mounted-visitor-info-setup.jpg[]
+
. Next, navigate to the guestbook URL by navigating pasting this in the *Browser Preview*
+
[.console-input]
[source,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
localhost:8081/hello.html
----
+
. Once there, enter a name (such as _Danny_) into the name field and press Submit
. You should now see _Danny_ (or whatever name you entered) added to the `{guestbook-record-file}` on the host in real time
